Backend requirements checklist for frontend integration

1) Base URL
- Production and staging API base (e.g. https://api.example.com)
- Any path prefix (e.g. /api or /api/v1)

2) Health endpoint
- Path (e.g. /health) and example successful response (HTTP 200 and JSON {"status":"ok"})

3) Auth scheme
- Type (JWT / OAuth2 / session cookies / none)
- Login and token endpoints (/auth/login, /auth/refresh)
- Token format, expiry times, refresh flow, public JWKS or OIDC discovery URL if applicable

4) CORS policy
- Allowed origin(s) for the frontend
- Allowed methods and headers
- Whether credentials (cookies) are allowed

5) TLS / SSL
- Is TLS terminated at LB/CDN? (Yes/No)
- Certificate provider and whether HTTPS is mandatory for clients

6) Rate limits & retry guidance
- Per-client limits and status codes returned on throttling
- Whether a Retry-After header is included and suggested retry policy

7) API versioning and compatibility
- Current API version and versioning scheme (header or path)
- Breaking-change policy and deprecation window

8) Error response format
- Example error payload fields (e.g., message, code, details, validation errors)

9) Important endpoints used by the frontend
- List endpoints and example request/response for: login, cache (/cache/download), topics, navigation, etc.

10) Cookie/session settings (if using cookies)
- Cookie names, domain, SameSite, Secure, HttpOnly flags

11) Deployment & DNS details
- Hosting platform (Render/Heroku/Azure/Vercel/Custom)
- DNS names, env var names to set (e.g., VITE_API_URL)
- Any path rewrites or proxies

12) DB migrations & rollback procedure
- How migrations are applied and rollback steps in case of failure

13) Monitoring & health hooks
- Metrics or health endpoints, log access, and any smoke-test or post-deploy webhook to call

14) Temporary test credentials
- A staging/test user (username/password or token) and scope to run smoke tests

15) Additional notes
- Any auth headers required, custom headers, or client IP restrictions

---
Provide these details (or a short doc) and I will: configure the frontend env, add a health-check, add retries/backoff to the API client, and create a smoke-test script to run after deployment.
